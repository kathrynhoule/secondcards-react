# React + Vite
This project utilizes Vite, as well as React and the React packages react-refresh and react-icons, along with router. React-refresh is necessary to view the images as they are currently set up, and three of the icons used on the app require react-icons. Router is used to switch between the pages of the site.

# General Information
This application is intended for an e-commerce website selling trading cards. Currently, the application has limited functionality, but is intended to display a simple header on each page with some navigation list items. The shop page contains a search bar and some placeholders for buttons, as well as a simple gallery with some example images put in.

# Updates
Since the last assignment, the focus has been on updating the css towards a newer design I have been working on, although most of the updates have been to the header and search bar only so far. In the future, the rest of the app's css will be updated as well.
The placeholder search bar has now been replaced with a search bar that can be typed in. Some set-up has been done with the search bar in order to use useState with it, but the functionality is not yet complete. This will be completed once some product data gets added and product card and product list components are made.
The app now uses router so that the user can click on the different header links to switch between the pages on the site.
